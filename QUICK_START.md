## 🚀 Next Steps (Follow These In Order!)

### Step 1: Set Up Your API Key

1. **Get Gemini API Key**:
   - Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy your key

2. **Create `.env` file**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit `.env` and add your key**:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your_actual_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Test Gemini Connection

```bash
python test_gemini.py
```

You should see: ✅ "Success! Gemini API is working!"

### Step 4: Run the Backend Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open: http://localhost:8000

You should see: "AI Meeting Assistant API is running! 🎙️"

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
→ Make sure you created `.env` file in the `backend/` folder

### "Module not found"
→ Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the backend folder

### "Port already in use"
→ Stop other running servers or use a different port:
   `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001`
